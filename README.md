# lights_out_quantum
This project contains our experiments and codes for the paper "Benchmarking Lights Out problem on real quantum hardware". Below, we describe where to find experiments that we mention in the paper.

Experiments that we performed on IBM quantum computers are located in folders:
- "IBM 2x2 grid first experiments";
- "IBM 2x2 grid 5 days";
- "IBM 6 lamps";
- "IBM small instance".

Experiments that we performed on IQM quantum computers are located in folders:
- "IQM 2x2 grid";
- "IQM 6 lamps";
- "IQM small instances".

Folder "IQM small instances" contains some extra experiments, main experiments for the 5-qubit circuit are located in files:
- "IQM Emerald.ipynb";
- "IQM Garnet.ipynb";
- "IQM Sirius.ipynb",
and experiments for the 2-qubit circuit are in file "IQM 2-qubit circuit.ipynb".

Folder "ibm_miami bad calibration" contains calibration data that serves as example when quantum device had large readout error rates.
